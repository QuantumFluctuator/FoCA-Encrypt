# FoCA-Encrypt
FoCA encryption assignment for Sheffield Hallam University.
Harness code written in C++ with encryption performed in x86 assembly.

## Compiling
I cannot verify that this code will work on all operating systems and IDEs due to the imports used by this code, however it is known to work under Windows (32 bit or 64 bit) with Visual Studio 2017.
